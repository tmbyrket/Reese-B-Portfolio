                <h2>About Reese</h2>          
                <p>I have spent the past 6+ years working in the sales and buying retail industry. My current job role is with David's Bridal HQ. In the past 3 years here, I earned the ownership of all Designer Bridesmaids departments and reported directly to the Senior Buyer. Professionally, my largest accomplishment was concpetualizing, developing, and launching an exclusive new brand that results in revenues of $9 million and gross margin of $5million. This brand was specifically designed to capture the digital customer that had previously been a void for the company, particularly in comparison to the other competitors in this retail category.
                    <br/>
                    Three months after the brand launched, the online penetration to the total business was 9% . After analyzing the digital customer's unique shopping behavior, I partnered cross-functionally with the Web Operations Team to customize customer-facing interations for this brand. These changes resulted in an increase to an average of 30% online penetration for the new brand by the end of its first year of launch.
                    <br/>
                    But more importantly, this was when I realized I had a passion for web development. Afetr spending over a year working closely in a non-technicaly capacity with our Web Operations and Digital team, I realized that I had a strong interest in learning as much as possible about Full-Stack Web Development. This led to me apply, and enrolling in Vanderbilt's Web Development Bootcamp this past spring. This six month program prepared me for a career in Web-Development that I am excited to pursue.
                    <br/>
                    Take a look below to see my deployed portfolio of work samples I have completed this past year.
